## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Regression analysis is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In this project, we aim to develop regression models (Linear Regression, ) that can accurately predict continuous target variables (CO2 emission) based on given features.

## Data Preprocessing <a name="data-preprocessing"></a>

### Overview

1. **Handling Missing Values**: Utilized techniques such as imputation and deletion to address missing values in the dataset.
2. **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Converted categorical variables into numerical representations using one-hot encoding.
3. **Feature Scaling**: Scaled numerical features using standardization to ensure all variables were on a similar scale.
4. **Train-Test Split**: Split the data into training and testing sets using holdout validation.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) <a name="eda"></a>

### Overview

1. **Summary Statistics**: Calculated descriptive statistics to summarize the data and identify any outliers or anomalies.
2. **Data Visualization**: Created visualizations like histograms and scatter plots to explore the distribution and relationships between variables.
3. **Correlation Analysis**: Computed correlation coefficients to identify correlations between variables and detect multicollinearity.
4. **Outlier Detection**: Identified outliers using techniques like Z-score and visual inspection.

## Feature Engineering <a name="feature-engineering"></a>

### Overview

1. **Feature Transformation**: Applied log transformation to numerical features to improve their distribution.
2. **Feature Scaling**: Scaled features using min-max scaling to ensure all variables were on a similar scale.
3. **Feature Selection**: Selected relevant features based on correlation analysis and feature importance scores to reduce dimensionality.

## Results <a name="results"></a>

| Model                           | MSE            | MAE            | RMSE           | R2             |
|---------------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Ridge Regression                | 1.558e10       | 81629.23       | 124805.21      | 0.4345         |
| Linear Regression               | 1.532e10       | 80348.83       | 123771.48      | 0.4438         |
| Decision Tree (Tuned)           | 1.865e10       | 27348.99       | 136555.57      | 0.3230         |
| Random Forest (Tuned)           | 9.747e9        | 26766.68       | 98726.23       | 0.6461         |
| Gradient Boosting (Tuned)       | 1.148e10       | 26766.68       | 98726.23       | 0.5834         |
| Neural Network (Tuned)          | 1.594e10       | 90547.34       | 126263.86      | 0.4212         |

From the table, we can observe that:

- Random Forest with tuned hyperparameters achieved the lowest MSE and RMSE among all models, indicating better predictive performance.
- Linear Regression also performed well, with competitive MSE, MAE, and RMSE scores.
- Decision Tree, although tuned, shows higher MSE and RMSE compared to other models, suggesting it might not generalize well to unseen data.
- Gradient Boosting and Neural Network models have similar performance metrics, with R2 scores around 0.58, indicating moderate predictive capability.

Overall, based on the provided metrics, Random Forest with tuned hyperparameters seems to be the best-performing model for this dataset, followed closely by Linear Regression. However, further analysis such as cross-validation and testing on unseen data would provide more robust conclusions.
